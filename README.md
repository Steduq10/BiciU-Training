Like borrow a bicycle, here we read the information in the bicycle data.txt file, and the user has the option to choose between and road or mountaint bicycle, input the start time and then receive a ticket of the service. Like return a bicycle where the user input the end time and tell us if the bicycle is in good conditions and if it has a helmet  or not. Depending of the answer the user has to pay an amount of the ticket.
Like pay a ticket where the user decide if wants to pay or not and also, like see the ticket history where the user can see the history of all the tickets or by code or by status. All the history is save in the tickets.txt file and it can be reading or writing. This is execute since the class Main where we have the main method.
